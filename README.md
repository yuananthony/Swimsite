This project is created to help swim coaches keep track of their swimmers times. A template was used
to create the home page of the website and the template was downloaded from startboostrap.com. The
other two pages were created by me and all php in the files were added by myself. This is an on going
project that I plan to keep working on and grow. In the near future an app will also be created to more
easily add times to the database.
