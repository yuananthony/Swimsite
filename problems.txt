This file was created to document problems that need to be fixed.

MUST FIX

    Create Timer page

    Need to create a results page that shows more details of selected swimmers in Events page

    Code Search Selected Events

    Write code to make sure users are entering the required information and prompting what is required

    Write code to make sure there are no collisions (add swimmer in single event twice in same meet and other checks)

AESTHETICS

    Put each field in their own line

    Make a better looking background

    Events > Select > checkbox is not centered

OPTIONAL


NOTES:

    Timer page

      When first clicked will ask if timing from created meet or creating meet as they time

          From Created meet

            Will need to select meet that they are timing before clicking.

            If user wants to select from created meet will need to enter swimmer and event
            before every time they start timing.
